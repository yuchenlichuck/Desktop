    Answer to Question 1
    </h1></center>

From the image of question 1, we can see 
$$
\frac{7mm}{35mm}=\frac{z}{500mm}
$$
so we can acquire that z=100mm. And for per line per mm we can find that 1024/100=10 elements/mm

and to obtain the line pairs we divide by 2 so the resolution is **5 line pairs/mm**
